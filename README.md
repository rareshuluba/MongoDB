# MongoDB

For this project I wanted to see the functionality of the MongoDB database and the connectivity with web applications.

The web application is called 'To-do List' and I used Express, Node.js, Angular and MongoDB with the platfrom Mongo Atlas.

It allows the user to enter the daily tasks to keep track of them for an efficient completion.
